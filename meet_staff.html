						<h3>Barbara</h3>
						<p>Positions: Owner, Director, Head of Plot (Palla), NPC Guild (BroS), Rules Marshal, TP Manager, Discord Admin, Web Admin</p>
						<p>Contact Email: <a href="mailto:owner@refugelarpportland.com">owner@refugelarpportland.com</a>, <a href="mailto:plot@refugelarpportland.com">plot@refugelarpportland.com</a></p>
						<p>Social Media: On Discord and Facebook - please DM me if needed!</p>
						<p>Bio: Barbara (they/he/she) has been LARPing with Refuge Portland since 2009 - when it was still a part of its prior organization. They have both PC'd and NPC'd for years, and are currently absolutely enamoured with heading up plot for the Palla campaign. They are pretty sure there's nothing they like better than telling stories with other players - except maybe their spouse and child. Barbara has also served in other roles within both the Refuge and other local LARPs, like Logistics and NPC chef, and has been low-key obsessed with LARPing since they started playing. While they are new to being an owner, they think that their experience with the game and their incredible staff and player base will help give them the guideance needed to be successful in the role. Given the trials of the pandemic, Barbara is ecstatic to get back to LARPing regularly - although they enjoyed the online events that were run as well - and can't wait to resume the hobby that has been their passion for so long.</p>

						<p>Social Media: On Discord</p>
						<p>Bio: Brian is a fun and exciting person (although I'm biased, being his wife). He has been larping with Refuge Portland for over a decade, and loves this game with a passion. Although he doesn't get to attend as many games lately as he would like (there's a really cute baby involved in that choice), he does love hearing all the stories and helping out behind the scenes.</p>

						<p>Social Media: None</p>
						<p>Bio: Rick is a barely functional adult who's favorite color is blue, while their favorite type of humor is the self-deprecating kind.  He's been LARPing for a decade now, which continues to blow his mind every time he consciously thinks about it.  He loves how player agency can mold a game world and doesn't mind working up a sweat in combat.  He also firmly believes that new players are the lifeblood of our organization and will go out of his way to help them both in- and out-of-game.</p>

						<p>Bio: Nas is fairly new to our organization, but has already made waves with his dedication, focus, and character-centric story-telling. He's a true delight to NPC with, and has a focused and orderly approach to our game, which makes him an ideal Assistant GM.</p>

						<p>Contact Email: <a href="mailto:logistics@refugelarpportland.com">logistics@refugelarpportland.com</a></p>
						<p>Social Media: None</p>
						<p>Bio: Corin has been larping since early 2016 and can sometimes be specific to a fault, which is almost certainly how they ended up in both Logistics and Rules positions.  They greatly value the Refuge Portland Larp community for giving them the space to grow and actualize themself, as well as the ways in which the Larping creates unexpected and deeply personal experiences you couldn't find anywhere else.</p>

						<p>Bio: Sherry is a long-time member of the RPG gaming community who re-added LARPing to that hobby 5 years ago.  In addition to playing Refuge, she participates in a regular TTRPG gaming group as both GM and player and is a board member of a Gaming Convention.  When she isn’t gaming, she enjoys sewing and being generally crafty.  Her penchant for being organized, planning, and details has led her to taking on the role of logistics.</p>

He has an expansive depth of story to draw from, and we're excited to see what Thevran brings to the game world.</p>
