				<h3>Packing for Game</h3>
				<p>LARPing is one part "glamping", one part Dungeons and Dragons game, and one part period drama from a packing perspective. Here is a list of things that are highly recommended for folk to bring to the game. It's sorted by <a href="#general">General</a> (things everyone should bring), <a href="#pc">PC</a> (things PCs should definitely bring) and <a href="#npc">NPC</a> (things NPCs should definitely bring). There's also a handy list of <a href="#nope">what not to bring</a> to help, too. Feel free to look at the other lists if you want ideas for other things to bring, but you really don't need much other than what's on your own list and the general list.</p>

				<section id="page_purple" class="page">
					<h3 id="general">General Supplies to Bring</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>A sleeping bag, pillow and/or other sleeping equipment. All our sites have heat in the cabins, so you don't need a special sub-zero sleeping bag or anything, just a regular one. Some people just prefer blankets and no sleeping bag - that's fine too! Our cabins all also have mattresses, so you don't need to bring camping pads or anything.</li>
						<li>Any sleeping devices you need (like CPAPs or APAPs). Some (but not all) of our cabins have power outlets, and those that do can be claimed by those who need CPAPs at night.</li>
						<li>Batteries for CPAPs if applicable.</li>
						<li>Socks. Like 5 more pairs than you think you need. We often LARP in wet weather, and there's nothing like nice dry socks to make your feet feel better when they're wet and cold.</li>
						<li>Undergarments. Self-explanatory.</li>
						<li>Shower supplies, if you desire. There are showers at all our sites that can be used by anyone over the course of the weekend. Shampoo, conditioner, soap, and towels are recommended, as well as something to wear on your feet in the showers.</li>
						<li>Hygene products. Pads/Tampons if needed, deodorant (please! - we get sweaty and smelly quickly otherwise), toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush, etc.</li>
						<li>Eye-care stuff, if applicable. Contact cases and solution are a must - you never know when you'll need them! Also, it might be wise to bring a backup pair of glasses if you wear/need them to drive. Head shots aren't allowed at game, but they <strong>could</strong> happen by accident, and no one wants broken glasses with no backup.</li>
						<li>A change of street clothes for Sunday afternoon. We usually go from game to afters, and that's almost always at a restaurant in a nearby town that will give you odd looks for being in period garb. A change of clothes is always a good idea if you need to leave site for any reason, too.</li>
						<li>Really good shoes with ankle support. Rolled ankles suck, and really good shoes are worth their weight in gold in this game. You'll be hiking, fighting, and walking a LOT in this game, so make sure they're comfortable, already broken in, and safe. You are welcome to wear non-period shoes if you can't find something in genre that works for you. Hiking boots, military surplus boots, and many other options exist.</li>
						<li>If you want to tent camp, bring your tent camping supplies: tent, stakes, rain shield, etc.</li>
						<li>Any medications you need for the game (including epipens!). It's a good idea to bring the pill bottles, but you might want to only bring enough for the one game so if they get lost, it isn't devastating. - Note, if you have a life-threatening allergy, please be sure staff (and probably your bunk mates) knows of it and what to do in the case of an emergency!</li>
						<li>Earplugs. Snoring is a thing, and earplugs are awesome. Also, sometimes people come into the cabin really late, and if you don't want to wake up from that, earplugs are great.</li>
						<li>Your health insurance card, if applicable, and any other emergency bracelets/emergency contact information/etc. Accidents happen and people have been known to need to go to the hospital or urgent care. Please be prepared for this (hopefully never needed) possibility.</li>
						<li>Weather-appropriate gear, such as bug spray, sunscreen and the like.</li>
						<li>Special cookware if needed for your meals. Don't count on their being cast iron pans, rice cookers, and other specialty equipment in the kitchens - they tend to contain fairly basic (if HUMONGOUS) items.</li>
						<li>Cell phone charger (we do love our electronics, but most sites don't have reception, so don't plan on using it for much more than a clock/flashlight)</li>

				<h3 id="pc">Supplies PCs Should Bring</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Your character's garb. Ideally, bring at least 2 outfits, but if you only have one, that's fine. It just might get wet/dirty/stinky by the end of the weekend.</li>
					<li>Your character's armour, if applicable.</li>
					<li>Your character's Gear physreps. This includes potion vials, spell books, wands/sources, etc.</li>
					<li>Your character's weapons. You may want a backup too.</li>
					<li>Food (unless there's a meal plan offered). Many people average 16,000 steps during an event, so when I do cooking for NPCs, I try to plan for about 4000 Calories a day. Feel free to adjust that however you like based on your own personal needs, but it's a good ballpark. You'll need a LOT more food than you think to keep from going hungry, and in order to keep up your energy for the Satruday night fight. Just keep that in mind!</li>
					<li>A good cloak with a hood. You're likely to get cold or wet during the event, and a cloak can mitigate that nastiness. It's a good investment and rather easy to find. I strongly recommend wool or fleece to keep you warm even if it's wet.</li>
					<li>Any makeup or physreps you need to rep your species appropriately. Be sure to bring isopropyl alcohol wipes or spray to clean the makeup after you use it. Also, don't forget brushes, sponges, makeup-removing wipes, face cream for after removal (that stuff can be brutal on your skin) and barrier spray. You may also need elf ears, horns, prosaid or spirit gum to affix things, etc.</li>
					<li>Something to wear under your costume when it's wet/cold. We often LARP in bad weather. Bring something warm like UnderArmour to keep you warm when that happens. It'll be a life-saver for sure!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Optional stuff/Being "Hella Extra":</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A tapestry or something to hang over/around your bunk if you want to look a bit more stylish. Feel free to bring more than one! Others will probably have some to borrow if you don't know what to do with this.</li>
					<li>An in-genre spoon, fork, knife, plate, and cup. They can make the place feel more period and are fun to have around. They are NOT required.</li>
					<li>In genre writing supplies. I would strongly recommend some kind of writing things - it's hard to keep track of everything between games if you don't write things down - and in-genre ones are sometimes just more fun. At bare minimum, bring a journal and a ballpoint pen, and at the most extreme people have used dip-pens and fountain pens, fancy books and all sorts of other things.</li>
					<li>Period musical instruments. Everyone loves a good jam sesh, and LARPers are no different! If you play an acoustic instrument that might be in genre and want to show off, bring it along! (Try to avoid expensive equipment as it might get lost or damaged.) We've seen harps, guitars, ukeleles, lutes, lyres, all sorts of things!</li>
					<li>An in-genre parisol/umbrella or hat. It's great for keeping rain or sun off if it gets atmospheric out.</li>
					<li>Some trinkets that tie into your backstory. These are great conversation starters! You can have a special bracelet your mother gave you before she died, or a token from a former lover, whatever.</li>

				<section id="page_green" class="page">
					<h3 id="npc">Supplies NPCs Should Bring</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Black clothes (several changes). We wear theatre blacks under all our gear. Ideally these don't have logos or large images on them, but if that's all you got, we'll work with it (and maybe ask you to turn it inside out).</li>
						<li>A black hoodie or coat. We play in all kinds of weather, and it can get COLD on site, even in the summer. A hoodie or coat will keep you warm while you play.</li>
						<li>Food if you aren't on the NPC meal plan. Many people average 16,000 steps during an event, so when I do cooking for NPCs, I try to plan for about 4000 Calories a day. Feel free to adjust that however you like based on your own personal needs, but it's a good ballpark.

			</article>
			<article class="article center_article">
				<h3 id="nope">What Not to Bring</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Anything expensive. Things get broken, lost or occasionally stolen from our game (usually stolen by random people who walk on site, but it's happened before). Don't bring expensive things to game, please.</li>
					<li>Anything electronic. Video game systems (like Switches), laptops (see above), electric instruments, and other such things should be kept at home. You can bring your phone (and most people do), but be prepared to leave it in your bunk during game.</li>
					<li>Money. You should try to keep your cash on hand to a limited amount (like, what you need to check in plus a few bucks for after-game food and gas). Don't bring $10,000 or anything. You won't need it, and it might get stolen.</li>
