				<h3>The Pre-Registration Details for our Camp Lutherwood Game</h3>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section>
			<article class="article center_article">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>This is for the Refuge Portland Broken Shards Closer event happening on March 15 - 17, 2024 at Camp Lutherwood near Cheshire, OR! We will be using the current ruleset which includes the <a href="https://www.refugelarp.org/documents/Refuge_LARP_Playtest_Packet_March_2023-2.pdf" target="_blank">March 2023 Playtest Packet</a>. The XP for this event cap is 110 XP and PCs will need to generate characters in the Freeplay database and email a pdf copy to <a href="mailto:refuge.portland.logistics@gmail.com">refuge.portland.logistics@gmail.com</a>. See <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cutdowncard2" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/cutdowncard2</a> for instructions on how to do this. Note that you are not limited to skills your character would normally have.</p>
				
				<p>Registration is now OPEN! (If you have missed the early registration deadline please still send in a registration if you are planning on coming to the event. While you may not get the discount it still helps check-in run more smoothly). Early registration deadline is Friday, March 8th, at 11:59 PM. We will give you 30 chapter points if you register by this time!</p>
				
				<p>To register, please visit the <a href="https://db.refugelarp.org/events/442" target="_blank">event sign up page</a>.</p>

				<h3 class="red_text">Pre-Registration Information</h3>
				<p>We have removed High Magic, Artificing, and Crafting choices from our pre-registration options.</p>
				<p>All PCs can fill in any High Magic and Artificing choices they want to start with before game on, and the crafting station will be made available before game on (but you will need to also find a crafting marshal to do so, as normal).</p>
				<p>LCS Ritual Scroll and Auto-Cast Ritual requests must be emailed to Logistics no later than the early registration deadline.</p>
				<p>Pre-registered MI tags will be marked as used in the database by default for PCs attending the event. It will be the player's responsibility at check in to inform Logistics if any MIs are being added or removed from what they pre-registered. MI hole punches will be available as part of the conversion station so that there's less bottlenecking at check-in.</p>
				<p><strong>Pre-payment no later than 48 hours before event</strong> is now required to qualify for the lower event fee and bonus chapter points. <strong class="red_text">Note we have changed to Square for payment, see links below in the Event Fee section.</strong></p>

					<h3>Important Information</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>We are using the current ruleset which includes the March 2023 Playtest Packet rules, which can be found <a href="https://www.refugelarp.org/documents/Refuge_LARP_Playtest_Packet_March_2023-2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></li>
						<li>If you are planning to utilize a skill that is in the ruleset but not in the database (such as Performance) please hold back the appropriate points for purchase and this can be signed off at logistics during check-in.</li>
						<li>Note that some items do not exist in the current ruleset. Liquid Light alchemy, Light Scrolls, Silvered Weapons, Silver Coatings, Workshops, and most Contraptions have been removed under the playtest. You may keep these items, and we are offering alternative ways to utilize them during the playtest, however it is important to note that this removal is not guaranteed to be implemented with the next permanent rules update, so players will have to decide for themselves now if they wish to exchange items now or wait and see.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Liquid Light alchemy may instead be used as a Vorpal 5 Coating. Light scrolls may be used as an Evocation Bolt 5 scroll of a standard element of the user's choosing.</li>
							<li>Silvered weapons may be brought into game and used as a normal weapon of the same type. If you wish you may exchange them at Logistics for an equivalent normal weapon tag, 15 silver, and 3 PP of Smithing-related materials. Silver Coatings may be exchanged for an equivalent value of Smithing-related Materials.</li>
							<li>Players with Workshops may either turn them in at Logistics for 100 PP/10 gold worth of Material tags usable by the relevant crafting skill or keep them and utilize the following LCS rule:"A Game Room with the appropriate Workshop fulfills the requirement of a Circle of Power for Ritual Casting when using Formal Artificing only."</li>
							<li>Any Contraptions not matching a Contraption listed in the Playtest Packet may be exchanged for an equivalent value of Engineering-related Materials.</li>
							<li>Check in your magic items in the pre-registration form as normal.</li>
						</ul>

				<h3>General Reminders</h3>
				<p>Proof of COVID-19 vaccine must be presented at check-in to play.</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="red_text">Proof of a COVID-19 rapid test within 24 hours of game-on (10 pm).</li>
					<li>You will be asked to show proof of this negative test in the form of a picture of the negative test, the date (ideally written on the test in sharpie), and your face. All three of these things must be in the same picture. Alternatively, you are welcome to take the test on-site and show it directly to the person doing COVID screenings. If you choose to do this, please bring your own test. If, for any reason (including finances), you cannot acquire a rapid test, we will have a small number of rapid tests available with the person doing COVID screenings. Tests cost about $10 a piece, and if you use a test please consider making an equivalent donation if you are able to do so.</li>
					<li>Please see our full <a href="https://www.refugelarpportland.com/policies_safety.html#covid" target="_blank">COVID-19 policy</a> for further details. Questions, comments or concerns may be directed to <a href="mailto:owner@refugelarpportland.com">owner@refugelarpportland.com</a>.</li>
					<li>Alliance coins and merchant items are now being converted! Old coin can be marked with a non-red paint pen at check-in to indicate that it has been converted and is valid for use in game. If you would like to receive new Refuge coin in order to preserve your old coin for separate use in Alliance, please email Logistics to arrange a way to get your old coin delivered to us for pre-marking before the early registration deadline. If you have old Merchant Code items, please email Logistics with the codes, amounts, and either a photo or a description of how they were marked.</li>
					<li>If your character has not been played before, please complete a copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hGGaHpFqTtsEzzNqpKCi7dolgJ6gBCZV6SGjKOPl-ZE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">New Character Starting Gear</a> document and email it to <a href="mailto:logistics@refugelarpportland.com">logistics@refugelarpportland.com</a>. We will be unable to generate new character magic items for you at check-in and you will not be able to do this at a later date.</li>
					<li>Alliance tags that have not been marked as waived from conversion will not be valid for use in game.</li>
					<li>All of your pre-Refuge treasure and gear must have been sent in for conversion in one form or another, either through the Portland chapter or another Refuge chapter. For details on how to get your items converted, please see the Portland Treasure Conversion Guidelines - if you still need to convert items to Refuge reach out to Logistics by Jan 12th at 11:59pm for assistance. If you do not submit your conversion in time then you will need to choose between either forfeiting conversion of your magic items or coming into game with no tags.</li>
					<li>Old Arrow/Bolt tags may be used as Vorpal 2 Coating, and Silver Arrows/Bolts may each be used as Vorpal 5 coatings. This may be done without exchanging the tags. </li>
					<li>Items with the Enhance Quiver ritual will instead function as one of the new rituals listed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EA-pXxIEUsjlgWdEkhHRsmv7mWxwpeVFQLVduOBnn5w/edit" target="_blank">here</a>. Enhance Quiver 60 or less will instead function as Infinite Quiver, and Enhance Quiver 80 or Limitless will function as both Infinite Quiver and Storm Quiver.</li>
					<li>Character cards are typically printed roughly one week before event, and never earlier than the early registration deadline. Re-prints of cards to account for new skill purchases after Logistics has already printed cards for the event are possible, however you will be subject to the late registration event price and will not receive bonus chapter points for early registration.</li>
					<li>If you are a PC and have spells to prepare, you will need to set memorization lists. If this is not complete it means you will have to hand write them on your card before game on or meditate them in-game after game on.</li>
					<li>Major omissions that hold up check-in will lead to your registration being considered incomplete and you will be subject to the at-the-door rate.</li>
					<li>A consolidated reference of Standard Local Chapter Rules, Policies, and Site Reminders can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ckEXRI25RNNMtvrdqQ5nMYnCGQbGhL_TS0-po6hWKVg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
